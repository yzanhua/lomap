Intro
========
This is a fork of [this GitHub Repo](https://github.com/wasserfeder/lomap).

I modified APIs so that it supports:
1. python 3.9
2. networkx 2.6
3. pp 1.6.4.4
4. ltl2dstar 0.5.4

Only APIs are modified. No modification to logics or implementations.

Usage
========
[Here](https://github.com/TiffanyYuanDe/lomap_docker) is a dockerfile, and [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/yzanhua/lomap) is a docker image, where you can use `lomap` directly with the help of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Or you can refer to the [install.sh](https://github.com/TiffanyYuanDe/lomap_docker/blob/main/install.sh) to check what commands
are used to install `lomap`.
